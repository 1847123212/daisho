Hardware Notes
==============

Schematic and layout files were designed in KiCad (release 2012-05-21
bzr 3261 -stable), an open source electronic design automation package.

Order and type of copper layers:
    1_top: signal, front ("component" side, where most components are mounted)
    2_gnd: ground plane
    3_inner: signal
    4_gnd: ground plane
    5_pwr: power plane
    6_inner: signal
    7_gnd: ground plane
    8_bot: signal, back

Impedance goals:
    50 Ohm +/- 10% microstrip, layers 1:2 at 7.0 mil (0.178 mm) width
    50 Ohm +/- 10% offset stripline, layers 3:2 at 6.5 mil (0.165 mm) width
    50 Ohm +/- 10% offset stripline, layers 6:7 at 6.5 mil (0.165 mm) width
    50 Ohm +/- 10% microstrip, layers 8:7 at 7.0 mil (0.178 mm) width

Soldermask
==========
Double side solder mask green
    +/- 5 mil solder mask registration

Silkscreen
==========
Double side silkscreen white
    6 mil silkscreen minimum width
    Silkscreen must be clipped by soldermask

Traces
======
5 mil (0.127 mm) min trace width
5 mil (0.127 mm) min trace isolation

Vias
====
8 mil (0.2032 mm) min via drill
17.7 mil (0.45 mm) min via pad
    4.85 mil min annular ring

Via-in-pad used in many places

Vias in pads need to be filled for assembly
    Most vias in pads are in capacitor footprints near the 780-BGA and 175-BGA

Drills
======
Drills are specified in two files:
    main_board.drl contains plated drills.
    main_board-NPTH.drl contains non-plated drills.
